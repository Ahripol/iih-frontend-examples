  <h1>Extras</h1>
  <p>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you may
    also be interested in <a href='../links.html'>links</a> or
    <a href='../images.html'>images</a>.</p>
  <h2>Character Sets</h2>

  <p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>bir</li>
    <li>iki</li>
    <li>üç</li>
    <li>dört</li>
    <li>beş</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
  <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You
    should always use HTML entities for these three characters. Entities
    always begin with an ampersand and end with a semicolon. In between,
    you put a special code that your browser will interpret as a symbol. In this case, it interprets lt,
    gt, and amp as less-than, greater-than, and ampersand symbols, respectively.</p>

  <h2>Curly Quotes</h2>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find
   yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>
